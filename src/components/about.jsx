                    <p>Hey there! I'm a skilled web developer and designer, and I've got quite the toolkit under my belt. From SQL, PHP, HTML & CSS to JavaScript with awesome frameworks like ReactJS and Vue.js. I'm also pretty comfortable working with MySQL, MongoDB, ASP.NET. But it's not just about the tech â€“ I've got a solid grasp on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and I've even dabbled in web analytics and data visualization.</p>
                    <p>I took on the Interactive Media Design - Web diploma program and really zoned in on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. Crafting responsive and visually appealing websites? That's my jam! Let's make the web a better place together!</p>
